Below is a brief summary of the test.

The solution included the following project
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Api
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Application
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Domain
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Infrastructure
•	VirginMedia.Sales.UnitTests
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Web which is a Blazor Project
•	VirginMedia.Sales.Web.Models

I have designed the application around Clean Architecture principles to achieve DDD and CQRS design using MediatR, The application itself is divided into the following layers
  Domain
  Application
  Infrastructure

I would have done some further refactoring to make the code more resilient and also increase code coverage by adding more tests and added more features to the Grid to add sorting and improve CSS.
